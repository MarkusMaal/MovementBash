 
Movement Bash - extra stuff

Under the "Extras" menu, you can do some additional and perhaps cool things!


* Previewing maps *

    This allows you to preview any map that exists in the maps
    directory without actually loading the maps! Just select a
    map from the file browser and a preview will be generated
    (for further info, see "Menu navigations" under help).
    
    Map preview example in Unicode mode:

        █▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█
        █▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█
        █████████

        Press any key to continue . . .

        #########

        Press any key to continue . . . 

* Generating random maps *

    Movement bash allows you to generate random maps, which
    contain walls and teleporters. Some of these maps will be
    impossible, but some may be solvable!
    
    Before you can generate a random map you'll be asked for
    the following details:
    
        Map name - This is what the map will be called. Set
        this to whatever you like.
        
        Map width - This is the width of the map. If you
        don't care, you can just press Enter and 20 will be
        selected as the default width.
        
        Map height - This is the height of the map. If you
        don't care, you can just press Enter and 5 will be
        selected as the default height.
    
    After entering these details, the game should now create a
    brand new map for you. If everything's finished, you should
    see the following message:
    
        Map generated!
        Press any key to continue . . . 
    
    The generated map can be accessed by loading a custom map
    with the name you specified before generating the map.
    
    Random map example:
    
        Movement Bash
        Loaded map: whatdoweknowaboutanything by Random Map Generator

        ░░░█░░░░░█▒░▒░░██▒▒░        
        ▒░▒█░▒█▒█▒░░█▒██▒▒▒░        
        ░░█▒░▒█▒▒▒░█▒▒░▒▒░█▒        
        ░▒█░░▒█░▒███░░F██▒@░        
        █░█░█▒░░░██▒███░███░        

    Note 1: The author's signature for these maps will always be
    set to "Random Map Generator"
    
    Note 2: The larger the map, the slower the performance will
    be. Try to avoid making ridiculously huge maps.

* Generating random map packs *

    This works very similar to how random map generator works, but
    it's for map packs and thus is even more simple.
    
    When prompted, enter the name for the map pack you'd like to
    generate and then the number of maps that should be in it
    (the default is 5 maps).
    
    That's it! Now you should be able to load this map pack from
    the main menu. You are even able to edit the map pack and
    remove any maps you don't like from it.
    
* Converting Movement Batch map geometry (alpha) *

    Since Movement Bash uses a completely different format for storing
    map data, it isn't natively backwards compatible with Movement
    Batch maps.
    
    This menu option can help you convert the geometry from a Movement
    Batch map to Movement Bash format. Please note that only the
    following data will be converted:
    
        - Map blocks (a1-a100 or a1-a400)
        - Start position (start)
        - Second start position (start2)
        - Map author (will be converted into a signature)
        
    The following data WILL NOT be converted and will have to be re-added
    manually:
    
        - Finish positions
        - Wall locations
        - Shootable objects
        - Unshootable objects
        - Custom scripts
    
    The following types of Movement Batch maps are supported:
    
        - Classic 20x5 no-color, no gravity maps
        - Modern 40x10 no-color, no gravity maps
    
    Color maps are not supported. Gravity maps will convert,
    but any gravity data will be lost.
    
    Since this option is in alpha, there WILL be conversion
    errors. If a faulty map is produced, you can delete it
    using the delete map option.
