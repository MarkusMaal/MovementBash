 
Movement Bash main menu

Movement Bash uses a simple menu navigation system.


* Navigating the menus *

    To navigate the menus, you must use the number [0-9] and/or
    letter keys [a-z]. After pressing a number or letter, you'll
    navigate to the menu, which the symbol was marked with.
    
    Example:
        1. Start
        2. Options
        3. Create
        4. Help
        5. Extras
        6. Exit
        
        If we want to go to the options menu, we press the [2] key.

* File browser *

    Depending on the situation, you may see Movement Bash's file
    browser, which looks something like this:
    
            Available maps

            [1] 1. aosjg
            [2] 2. blazemaze
            [3] 3. blocktest
            [4] 4. empty
            [5] 5. H1
            [6] 6. house
            [7] 7. huge
            [8] 8. i9uymi9r
            [9] 9. large

            [N] Next page
            [U] From URL
            [E] Return to previous menu

            Press a number or a letter to continue: 
    
    The numbers/letters correspond to the keys you can press to
    access that map/option. As an example, if we want to load a
    map called "i9uymi9r" from this list, we need to press [8]
    on our keyboard.
    
    Lets say we want to load a map called "normal". It doesn't
    isn't on this page, so we need to go to the next page. To
    do this, press the [N] key.
        
            Available maps

            [1] 10. map3
            [2] 11. markus
            [3] 12. maze
            [4] 13. medium
            [5] 14. minimal
            [6] 15. night
            [7] 16. normal
            [8] 17. normal2
            [9] 18. oh

            [N] Next page
            [P] Previous page
            [U] From URL
            [E] Return to previous menu

            Press a number or a letter to continue: 
            
    After doing so, we'll see "normal" in the list. We can press
    [7] to load this map. Notice how the map ID is different from
    the key we need to press to access it and that there's also
    now an option to go back to the previous page.
    
    You can press [E] to exit the file browser and cancel the
    operation.
    
    The from URL option allows you to manually enter the name of
    the map you want to load. This can be faster, if there are
    a lot of maps and you remember the exact name of the map.
    
    You may sometimes also see the "[C] Create new map" option.
    This allows you to make a new map instead of loading an
    exisiting one.


* Menu options *

	You'll see a menu, where you have the following options:
	
	1. Start
		---Standard maps---
		
		0-5

		Allows you to load built-in sample maps. You can
		press 0 on your keyboard to play all of the
		standard maps.

		6. Custom map

		Allows you to load a map that exist in the same
		directory as the bash script. Maps don't have a
		file extension and contain 2 lines of plain text.

		7. Map pack

		Similar to how Movement Batch worked, map packs are
		like playlists for maps. In Movement Bash, map packs
		can theoretically have infinite amount of maps. In
		order to finish the map pack, you'll need to finish
		all maps and/or skip the ones that can't be finished.
		You can do so, by pressing E.
		
		8. Go back
		
		Returns to the previous menu

		
	2. Options
	
		1. Change your signature: [your signature]

		Allows you to change your personal signature. This
		will be used in the main menu as well as the maps
		you make. See signature formatting under 'Help'
		for more information.

		2. Change your character: [your character]
		
		Allows you to change your character. By default,
		this is set to @, but you can type any other
		character you want to use.

		3. Change opponent's character: [opponent's character]
		
		Same as option 2, but for the second player. The
		default here is #.

		4. Shooting distance
		
		Set how many blocks can a bullet be fired by. Default
		is 5.

		5. ASCII mode: enabled/disabled

		If enabled, only ASCII characters are used in maps.
		Useful, if your terminal emulator doesn't properly
		support Unicode characters or if the map designer
		decided this is the mode they'd want to use.

		6. Multiplayer mode: enabled/disabled
		
		If enabled, 2 characters will be controllable on
		a map. Default: disabled

		7. Set controls
		
		Allows you to set up custom controls. This will
		ask you to press a desired button for the listed
		action.

		8. Reset settings

		Allows you to remove the existing configuration.
		You'll be asked to manually relaunch the game.

		9. Go back

		Return to the previous menu

		
	3. Create

		1. Create map or edit existing one
		
		Allows you to create new maps that you can load later.

        2. Create a map pack
	
		This allows you to create a new map pack or load an
		existing one.

		3. Rename map
		
        Allows you to rename an existing map. This renames
        every file that is tied to this map, which makes
        it easier than manually using the mv command.

        4. Rename map pack
        
        Allows you to rename an existing map pack.

        5. Delete map

        any other files tied to the map.

        6. Delete map pack
        
        Allows you to delete an ecisting map pack. Will
        NOT delete any maps contained in the map pack.

        7. Go back
        
        Returns to the previous menu.
		
	4. Help
	
		Help documentation for different aspects of the game.

		1. Quick start guide

		2. Signature formatting
		
		Shows different formatting options for signatures.

		3. Go back
		
		Return to the previous menu
