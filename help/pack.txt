Movement Bash map pack editor

Map packs are collections of maps. Think of them as a playlist for
Movement Bash maps. The map pack editor allows you to make and
edit these collections.


* Creating or loading a map pack *

Both actions can be performed by selecting "Create a map pack"
from the "Create" menu.

If you want to edit an existing map pack, choose a map pack from
the file browser.

If you want to create a new map pack, press [C] and then specify
a name for the map pack.

* Editing map packs *

Next you'll see the map pack editor. If you don't have any maps
selected, you'll see 5 options:

    1. Add map
    Allows you to browse for an existing map, that you want to
    add to the map pack. After adding a map, the number of maps
    should increase by one.

    2. Select map
    Allows you to select and list all maps in the map pack.
    If you select a map, you'll see additional options.
    
    3. Exit editor
    Exits the map pack editor and returns to the main menu.
    This will NOT, by itself, save any changes.
    
    4. Save map pack
    Saves any changes made to the map pack.

    5. Check maps
    Allows you to check, which maps in the map pack exist
    and which ones are invalid. Any errors found will be
    shown to the user and then fixed.

Once you select a map, you'll see a number of new options:

    1. Add map
    
    2. Select map
    
    3. Change map
    Allows you to change this map to
    something else.

    4. Remove map
    Removes this map from the map pack.

    5. Swap with another map in map pack
    Allows you to swap with another map i.e. reorder it.
    You'll be prompted to select, which map you want to
    replace the selected one with.

    6. Preview map
    Allows you to preview what the selected map looks like.
    Both Unicode and ASCII modes are previewed.
    
    7. Exit editor
    
    8. Save map pack
    
    9. Check maps

As you can see, some of the previous menu options
were re-numbered.
